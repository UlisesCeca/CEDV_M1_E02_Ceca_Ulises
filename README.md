# CEDV_M1_E02_Ceca_Ulises
Exercise 2 from the module 1 made with Unreal Engine 4 for the CEDV (Videogames development expert course || Curso de experto en desarrollo de videojuegos) from the ESI from the UCLM made using only C++


Rules:

The exercise will consist of an extension/modification of the project managed in the Classes and Inheritance sessions.

The minimum requirements for the fiscal year to be resolved are set out below:

Creation of a new hierarchy, in C++, of 3 different types of enemies.
Each type of enemy must behave differently, both among themselves and with respect to those provided in the Inheritance example.
Limit the maximum number of enemies that can appear on the map after elimination. For example, if this value is set to 25, then there can only be 25 enemy spawn actions in general.
Creation of a class, called AchievementManager, responsible for notifying events, graphically, when any of the following conditions are met:
Get a roll of eliminating a guy's n enemies. It must be parameterisable.
Get rid of all enemies without miss a shot.
Get rid of all enemies without getting hurt.
Some considerations:

The exercise is designed to be solved exclusively with C++.
The package containing the generated solution must not exceed 250MB.
With respect to the graphic part, the use of any resource whose license allows it is considered. 
With respect to multimedia resources, it is possible to use those available in the other case studies of the course or anyone with a license to use them. On the following pages there are many of them:

About the deliverable:

A short video (maximum 3 minutes) must be included with the game play.
The result of the solution of the exercise must be a. zip file with the content of the project (File->Zip Up Project) and whose name follows the following agreement: CEDV_M1_E02_last name1_name. zip (e. g. CEDV_M1_E02_Vallejo_David. zip). It is important that the packaged project can be opened in the EU4 facility itself. 
Due to the maximum size limitations of the tasks in Moodle, this. zip file must be uploaded to a platform such as WeTransfer or Dropbox and the resulting URL will be the one attached to the CampusVirtual task.
